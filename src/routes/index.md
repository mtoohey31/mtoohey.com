## Interests

### :computer: Programming

I enjoy working with low-level languages and doing systems programming. Some of the subfields I'm interested in are functional programming, language design, and OS design. Check out my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/mtoohey31).

### :penguin: + :snowflake: Linux

I recently switched from Arch to [NixOS](https://nixos.org/), and I've been loving the declarative way it allows you to manage your system's configuration. I'm still in the process of switching over some of the machines I use less frequently, but once that's done, all of my configuration will be stored at [mtoohey31/infra](https://github.com/mtoohey31/infra). I also recently swapped from [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) to [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) because of its first class support for tree-sitter and LSP. Helix also supports multi-cursor and takes inspiration from [Kakoune](http://kakoune.org/) in terms of its inverted (compared to Vim) approach to nouns and verbs, though it's still missing many features that make Vim and Neovim amazing, such as plugins...

### :keyboard: Mechanical Keyboards

I enjoy the hobby more so for the keymap customization than for the sound/feel/appearance aspects; my three keyboards and the keymap I use for each are linked below.

### :electric_plug: Self-hosting

I'm currently running a server with Arch Linux, ZFS, and a rather large `docker-compose` file for most of the heavy lifting such as network backups and SMB shares. I'm also running a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 4GB for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) and other lightweight services that need to be always-on. I'm really looking forward to boards for the Compute Module 4 that support M.2's so I can turn off the desktop for good!

### :speaker: Audio

I did audiovisual club in high school and really enjoyed it, so I have experience with recent Soundcraft SI Impact and Allen and Heath digital boards. I've also had some experience with DMX lighting boards and ATEM video switchers, including scripting a switcher using [atemOSC](https://github.com/danielbuechele/atemOSC).

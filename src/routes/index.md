## Hobbies

### :computer: Programming

My main languages are Python and Java (which we used in my first and second year CS courses respectively), as well and JavaScript/Typescript and Rust, which I've used on a lot of side projects. In terms of web development, I have some experience with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) (this site is built with [Svelte Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)). Check out my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/mtoohey31).

### :penguin: Linux

Though it's not perfect, I love Linux! I use Arch... and I've been really enjoying [sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway/) on Wayland recently. I'm also a long-time [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) user, I'm finally shifting my configuration over to Lua soon, and have been checking out the built-in LSP and Treesitter. Check out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/mtoohey31/dotfiles) if you're interested.

### :keyboard: Mechanical Keyboards

I'm the happy owner of a [Corne-ish Zen](https://lowprokb.ca/products/corne-ish-zen-2), a [Planck Light](https://drop.com/buy/massdrop-x-olkb-planck-light-mechanical-keyboard), a [CRKBD](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) (aka Corne) with Mill-Max hot-swap sockets installed and some quirks because of some unfortunate mistakes that were made during the build process... Check out my current keymaps for the [Corne-ish Zen](https://github.com/mtoohey31/zmk-config-Corne-ish-Zen), [Planck Light](https://github.com/mtoohey31/planck-keymap), and [CRKBD](https://github.com/mtoohey31/crkbd-keymap).

### :electric_plug: Self-hosting

I'm currently running a server with Arch Linux, ZFS, and a rather large `docker-compose` file for most of the heavy lifting such as network backups and SMB shares. I'm also running a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 4GB for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) and other lightweight services that need to be always-on. I'm really looking forward to boards for the Compute Module 4 that support M.2's so I can turn off the desktop for good!

### :speaker: Audio

I did audiovisual club in high school and really enjoyed it, so I have experience with recent Soundcraft SI Impact and Allen and Heath digital boards. I've also had some experience with DMX lighting boards and ATEM video switchers, including scripting a switcher using [atemOSC](https://github.com/danielbuechele/atemOSC).

## Hobbies

### ðŸ’» Programming

My main languages are Python (which we used in my first year university CS courses) and JavaScript, which I've used on a lot of side projects. In terms of web development, I have some experience with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) (this site is built with [Svelte Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)). I've also used Java quite a bit in the past for high-school courses, but often I find a Bash script the simplest way to solve a small issue. I've also taken a look at Rust but I haven't gotten to any projects using it yet, and I'm also trying to convince myself to learn C, or C++ soon, but that hasn't happened yet. Check out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/mtoohey31/dotfiles) or some of my other projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/mtoohey31).

### :keyboard: Mechanical Keyboards

<div style="display: flex; width: 100%;">
    <img src="/crkbd-kat-milkshake.jpg" alt="CRKBD with KAT Milkshake" style="max-width: calc(50% - 0.5rem); margin-right: 0.5rem;"/>
    <img src="/crkbd-epbt-2048-zilent-blueberries.jpg" alt="CRKBD with EBPT 2048 and Zilent Blueberries" style="max-width: calc(50% - 0.5rem); margin-left: 0.5rem;"/>
</div>

I'm the happy owner of a [CRKBD](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) (aka Corne) with Mill-Max hot-swap sockets installed and some quirks because of some unfortunate mistakes that were made during the build process... Check out my current keymaps for the [CRKBD](https://github.com/mtoohey31/crkbd-keymap) and my [Planck Light](https://github.com/mtoohey31/planck-keymap). I'm also waiting patiently for the [Corne-ish Zen](https://lowprokb.ca/products/corne-ish-zen-2), which I'm super excited to get my hands on!

### :speaker: Audio

I did audiovisual club in high school and really enjoyed it, so I have experience with recent Soundcraft SI Impact and Allen and Heath digital boards. I've also had some experience with DMX lighting boards and ATEM video switchers, including scripting a switcher using [atemOSC](https://github.com/danielbuechele/atemOSC).

### :electric_plug: Self-hosting

I'm currently running [TrueNAS Core](https://www.truenas.com/) with a [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) jail and SMB shares for backups over the network for large file storage, and running a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 4GB for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) and other lightweight services that need to be always-on. I'm really looking forward to boards for the Compute Module 4 that support M.2's so I can turn off the desktop for good.

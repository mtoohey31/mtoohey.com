<!-- cspell:ignore Toohey minored -->

Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Matthew Toohey</span>. I recently finished my undergrad at the University of Toronto, where I specialized in Computer Science with a focus in Computer Systems, and minored in Economics and Statistics. I'll be starting my master's there in the fall, and will be doing research on programming languages.
